# Weather-Dashboard

For this project, I created a website that draws information from a weather api, "openweathermap.org". After typing and searching up a city, the website will display the current weather conditions for that city. Additionally, a forecast of the next five days for that city will also be displayed. Previous search terms for the session will be displayed in the bottom left side column. These cities can be clicked, and will once again display their current weather condition. The uv index is also displayed and changes color based on the amount of uv radiation present. Here is a [screenshot](./assets/Weather%20Forecast.jpg) of my project in action.
